It appears to me that Pair Programming is, next to TDD, one of the most controversial of XP practices. It also appears
to me that most people criticising Pair Programming have never done it or, if they did, don't have too much experience
with it. Where the critique comes from? Comfort zone. You have to leave your shell behind and expose yourself to
making mistakes in front of someone else and prolonged communication. Basically, you're forced to get rid of your ego and
any kind of code authorship for the sake of benefits you don't believe in.

# Why Pair Programming?
There has to be some advantage you get by Pair Programming, if you're ever supposed to agree to something like this.

### Two Heads Are Better Than One
It's obvious that you will solve problems faster and produce better designs when you're working with someone. However
more comfortable wouldn't you feel when working alone, having someone to discuss your ideas and tackle problems with
leads to a huge quality boost.

### Prolonged Attention
When working in pair, you are less likely to mess around checking Twitter, reading stuff online or whatever else you do to
waste time. I don't mean that any of these is evil and you should never do it at work. I mean that when it's time to get
to work and get things done, it's way easier to focus and not get distracted when there's someone working with you. Also,
when you feel tired or just a bit off track, you can simply switch roles and keep working.

### Collective Ownership
Reading the code written by someone else gives you a completely different view than actively participating in writing it.
With Pair Programming, every piece of code has two authors with deep insight into it's creation process. If you rotate
your pairing partners and participate in a variety of tasks, you have a much wider perspective on the codebase. Because
you have to suppress your ego when pairing, you are less likely to be protective about deleting or changing your code.
It's much less pain to [Let It Go]().

### Built-in Code Review
(You are doing code reviews, aren't you?!)

Having 2 pairs of eyes see and review the code, you can either relax your code review process or let it go completely.
Depending on your team, it can be a huge time saver.

### Team Spirit
Regularly cooperating with your team members builds up a real team. You can't achieve the same level of understanding
and the same feeling of a collective when sitting alone with your headphones on. Effective cooperation is more than
daily stand-ups and bi-weekly ceremonies. It's daily discussions, whiteboard sessions and writing code together.

For sure, there's more benefits than that. I chose the most important and appealing to me.

# How To Begin?
Now, armed with a fantastic vision of all the benefits associated with Pair Programming, you're ready to start doing it
yourself. Here are a few practical tips:
* Just do it - too many people give up, before they even try, justifying that they are better working alone, that
management won't agree, that their project is special, bla, bla, bla. It's not.
* Take breaks - it's way too easy to get gripped and end up exhausted after a few hours with suboptimal effects. Same as
with working alone, you need to take breaks. Using Pomodoro technique is one of the ways to ensure regular breaks.
* Switch roles - the fact that you're using your or someone's computer doesn't mean that only you/that person is allowed
to touch the keyboard. On the contrary, for best results, you should switch regularly.
* Change partners - working all the time with the same person will limit the benefits of collective ownership, reviewed
code and improved team spirit.
* Set aside some time alone - despite the various benefits of various together, it's still important to have some time
for yourself, put your headphones on and bash some code alone.

# Summary
Pair Programming is about moving the emphasis from individual's ego to the collective by writing code together. There's
a lot of benefits to this approach, despite the discouraging voices of the naysayers. To get yourself on track to better
solutions, focus and team spirit, set aside some of your time for working with someone else. Make sure to keep things
diversified - take breaks, switch roles and change partners regularly for the best effect. Enjoy! (Yes, Pair Programming
can actually be enjoyable!)
