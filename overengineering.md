title: Overengineering
author: Grzegorz Ziemonski
summary: Reading a lot of stuff online and talking to people, I feel like there's a notion that the `interface` keyword is a sign of overengineering, legacy code and the old, complicated way of writing code in general. Microservices however... a completely different story! So small, simple, elegant... and powerful! Look at this scaling! Look at this fault tolerance! Look at this, look at that!

Reading a lot of stuff online and talking to people, I feel like there's a notion that the `interface` keyword is a sign
of overengineering, legacy code and the old, complicated way of writing code in general. Microservices however... a
completely different story! So small, simple, elegant... and powerful! Look at this scaling! Look at this fault tolerance!
Look at this, look at that!

I'd like to propose a thinking exercise. Imagine that you're working on a fairly sized enterprise project. Nothing
special, yet another e-commerce, ERP or whatever. The load is perfectly sustainable for a single instance, no need for
massive scaling etc. You noticed that the part of the project you've been working on has grown significantly and after
a quick analysis, you discovered 2 distinct responsibilities to be separated.

![Overengineering - Before](/img/overengineering-before.png)

Let's assume that `responsibilityA` depends on `responsibilityB`, both contain significant amounts of code and,
from now on, two different teams should be able to work on them independently.

# Overengineering
We'll start by overengineering the integration. The two teams meet together and work out a contract, which is represented
by a regular Java `interface`, documented with JavaDoc. All the messages sent via the interface are JDK types or simple
data structures (think: POJO with no methods besides accessors).

![Overengineering - After](/img/overengineering-after.png)

The team responsible for A stuff is only allowed to use classes from `responsibilityB.api` package. We could force that
by e.g. moving the package into a separate Maven module, but it's out of this article's scope.

# Microservices
Now we'll change this medieval, overengineered bullshit into simple, scalable microservices. Again, the two teams meet
and agree on a contract. This time, they'll use REST and JSON, documented by Swagger and protected by an integration
contract test.

Please note that necessary configurations like web client, service registry, circuit breakers etc. were left out.
And we didn't even touch on infrastracture and all configurations required for separate deployments.

# Conclusion
There's no particular conslusion. Use your own judgement.
